# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
A Basic Sentiment Analyser of Twitter Data

This Project was created to complete a Sentiment analysis of Twitter Tweets using Python programming.
We have used an input file data which had existing simulated tweet data collected. We also have used 
a positive word list and a negative word list which are used to match with the input data and arrive 
at the net Sentiment score of each tweet
